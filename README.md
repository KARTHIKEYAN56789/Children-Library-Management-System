# Children-Library-Management-System
The Children Library Management System is tailored to manage books and reading resources for children. The system tracks borrowing durations, applies fines for overdue books, and categorizes resources based on age groups. It also allows parents to register their children as members and borrow books.

# Key Features
Age-Based Categorization: Automatically organizes books and resources into specific age groups (e.g., Toddlers, Early Readers, Middle Grade, Young Adult) [1].

Parent-Child Account Linking: Allows parents to register as primary account holders and add their children as sub-members [2].

Smart Borrowing Tracker: Monitors borrowing durations with automated notifications for upcoming due dates.

Automated Fine System: Calculates and applies fines for overdue books based on pre-defined library policies.

Resource Management: Tools for librarians to add, update, or remove physical and digital reading materials.
